# Optical Detection of Electron Spin Resonance in NV⁻ Centres

This repository contains the code and documentation for a compact ODMR (Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance) platform using nitrogen-vacancy (NV⁻) centres in microdiamonds. The platform integrates optical excitation, microwave control, and synchronized photodetection to resolve zero-field and Zeeman-split spin transitions.

## 🔬 Project Summary

Negatively charged NV⁻ centres in diamond exhibit spin-dependent fluorescence under optical excitation and microwave driving. In this project, I built a tabletop system to:

- Resolve zero-field ESR transitions (~2.87 GHz).
- Detect Zeeman splitting under external magnetic fields.
- Synchronize data acquisition with a custom Python script.

**Key hardware**:  
- SG4400L RF Signal Generator (DS Instruments)
- Thorlabs SPCM20A Single-Photon Detector (Thorlabs)
- Moku:Lab Oscilloscope (Liquid Instruments)
- Neodymium magnet (~2.6 mT max)

## ⚙️ System Overview

The experiment setup includes:
- Laser excitation at 532 nm.
- Optomechanics for beam shaping and focusing.
- Dichroic optics and filters for fluorescence detection.
- Microwave delivery via PCB stripline (rigged up by Dr. Cyril Laplane).
- Python-based serial control of RF source and data acquisition.

Please see the report for the detailed optomechanical layout.
